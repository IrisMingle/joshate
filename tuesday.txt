All I know how to do is shake shake

Keep your body still, keep your body still

phantogram lyrics

"When I'm Small"

Lucy's underground,
She's got a mouth to feed
Am I underground,
Or am I in between

Lucy's underground,
She's got a mouse to feed
Am I underground,
Or am I in too deep

Show me love,
You've got your hand on the button now
Sure enough,
You've got your hand on the button now

Lucy's underground,
She's never coming back
Am I still alive,
Or has the light gone black

Take me underground,
Take me all the way
Bring me to the fire,
Throw me in the flames

So show me love,
You've got your hands on the button now
Sure enough,
You've got your hand on the button now

I'd rather die,
I'd rather die,
Than to be with you
